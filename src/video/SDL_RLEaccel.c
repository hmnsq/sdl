/*
 * RLE encoding for software colorkey and alpha-channel acceleration
 *
 * Original version by Sam Lantinga
 *
 * Mattias Engdegård (Yorick): Rewrite. New encoding format, encoder and
 * decoder. Added per-surface alpha blitter. Added per-pixel alpha
 * format, encoder and blitter.
 *
 * Many thanks to Xark and johns for hints, benchmarks and useful comments
 * leading to this code.
 *
 * Welcome to Macro Mayhem.
 */

/*
 * The encoding translates the image data to a stream of segments of the form
 *
 * <skip> <run> <data>
 *
 * where <skip> is the number of transparent pixels to skip,
 *       <run>  is the number of opaque pixels to blit,
 * and   <data> are the pixels themselves.
 *
 * This basic structure is used both for colorkeyed surfaces, used for simple
 * binary transparency and for per-surface alpha blending, and for surfaces
 * with per-pixel alpha. The details differ, however:
 *
 * Encoding of colorkeyed surfaces:
 *
 *   Encoded pixels always have the same format as the target surface.
 *   <skip> and <run> are unsigned 8 bit integers, except for 32 bit depth
 *   where they are 16 bit. This makes the pixel data aligned at all times.
 *   Segments never wrap around from one scan line to the next.
 *
 *   The end of the sequence is marked by a zero <skip>,<run> pair at the *
 *   beginning of a line.
 *
 * Encoding of surfaces with per-pixel alpha:
 *
 *   The sequence begins with an SDL_PixelFormat value describing the target
 *   pixel format, to provide reliable un-encoding.
 *
 *   Each scan line is encoded twice: First all completely opaque pixels,
 *   encoded in the target format as described above, and then all
 *   partially transparent (translucent) pixels (where 1 <= alpha <= 254),
 *   in the following 32-bit format:
 *
 *   For 32-bit targets, each pixel has the target RGB format but with
 *   the alpha value occupying the highest 8 bits. The <skip> and <run>
 *   counts are 16 bit.
 *
 *   For 16-bit targets, each pixel has the target RGB format, but with
 *   the middle component (usually green) shifted 16 steps to the left,
 *   and the hole filled with the 5 most significant bits of the alpha value.
 *   i.e. if the target has the format         rrrrrggggggbbbbb,
 *   the encoded pixel will be 00000gggggg00000rrrrr0aaaaabbbbb.
 *   The <skip> and <run> counts are 8 bit for the opaque lines, 16 bit
 *   for the translucent lines. Two padding bytes may be inserted
 *   before each translucent line to keep them 32-bit aligned.
 *
 *   The end of the sequence is marked by a zero <skip>,<run> pair at the
 *   beginning of an opaque line.
